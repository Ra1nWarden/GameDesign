Lab5 submission: (main method found in LabFiveGame.java)
Implemented gravity and hitbox such that mario cannot go through a platform but can land on them.
Use direction keys to navigate. When colliding with a platform, "Colliding with platform" is printed to console.
When colliding with a coin, the coin shuffles position.
